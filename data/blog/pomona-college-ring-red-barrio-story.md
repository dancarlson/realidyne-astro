title: "Pomona College - Ring of Red: A Barrio Story"
description: "'Ring of Red' is a new play spotlighting the history of Mexican Americans and the Vietnam War. Based on hundreds of hours of oral histories with Chicano Vietnam veterans and their families, this “testimonio” stage production connects audiences to the history of a generation of Mexican Americans coming of age during the Cold War, their pathways to war in Southeast Asia, and their struggles to find healing in the years since coming home."
